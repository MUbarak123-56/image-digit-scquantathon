# Simple Block - Zero Or One Image Digit Classification (South Carolina Quantathon Competition)

## Introduction

This project was conducted as part of the IonQ Quantum Vision Challenge at South Carolina Quantathon which was hosted by the Darla Moore School of Business at the University of South Carolina. The objectivre of this project is to devise a quantum layer within a hybrid quantum-classical neural network that is designed to differentiate between the digits 0 and 1. The quantum layer in this architecture is expected to perform a different role compared to the traditional quantum-classical neural network where the training is done using a lot of the classical layers with just one or two quantum layers involved in the training process. The quantum layer here is expected to conduct most of the training on the data set. Below are figures to display the different sections of the architecture.
